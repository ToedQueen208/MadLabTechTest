if using this method its asycnhronoius and didnt need other packlages installed

Rather than implementing my own sorting algorithm I used the inbuilt one from arrays.sort.
As a library function this is likely more efficient than any algorithm I will have written, it also saves time rather than re-inventing the wheel.
To use the library function you need to tell it how to compare objects. That is done using the bookIDComparator, which compares two objects (book results)
by their ID fields.
